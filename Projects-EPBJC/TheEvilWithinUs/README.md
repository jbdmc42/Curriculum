This project was created and developed by:
- João Correia
- Matias Lopes
- João Monteiro

The main purpose of this work was to be presented as a final course project in EPBJC.

The final grade of the project was 17/20.

This project involved the creation of the game The Evil Within Us and its website:
https://www.theevilwithinus.great-site.net


PRACTICAL EXPLANATION:
The game The Evil Within Us is a simple indie game where you have the main objective of collecting all of the car parts around the map while fighting hordes of zombies.
There are 7 car parts to collect, one of them being the car key. All car parts are exposed around the map, but in order to get the car key, we need to find the first 6 parts
to unlock the BOSS AREA door where we will find the zombie boss (a big zombie that deals more damage and has more health points, which also has a special attack. 
It becomes stronger when its health points are low.
When we kill the boss, we can search for the car key, and once we pick it up we win the game.

TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:
To create this project, we used 4 different tools:
- Unity > engine for the game development
- Visual Studio > IDE for the scripts production
- Blender > modeling app for the animation making
- Wordpress > web app for website creation

We DID NOT make the 3D models that we used and the full code of the website because we had no time to do it all by hand. 
We used Wordpress to create our website using templates. We also used the Unity Asset Store to find the 3D models and textures. The only thing we did make in this scope were
some of the animations used on the game.

The language used for the scripts was C#, object oriented programming.
